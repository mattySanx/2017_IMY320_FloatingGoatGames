					<p>The banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds
					of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas
					used for cooking may be called plantains, in contrast to dessert bananas. The fruit is
					variable in size, color and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft
					flesh rich in starch covered with a rind which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or 
					brown when ripe. The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant. Almost
					all modern edible parthenocarpic (seedless) bananas come from two wild species – Musa 
					acuminata and Musa balbisiana. The scientific names of most cultivated bananas are Musa
					acuminata, Musa balbisiana, and Musa × paradisiaca for the hybrid Musa acuminata × 
					M. balbisiana, depending on their genomic constitution. The old scientific name Musa
					sapientum is no longer used.</p>
					<p>Musa species are native to tropical Indomalaya and Australia, and are likely to have 
					been first domesticated in Papua New Guinea. They are grown in 135 countries, 
					primarily for their fruit, and to a lesser extent to make fiber, banana wine and banana
					beer and as ornamental plants</p>

				<p>The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus)[1][2] is a domesticated member of the horse family, Equidae. The wild ancestor 
				of the donkey is the African wild ass, E. africanus. The donkey has been used as a working animal for at least 5000 years. 
				There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as 
				draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers
				of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.</p>
				<p>A male donkey or ass is called a jack, a female a jenny or jennet; a young donkey is a foal.[5] Jack donkeys are often used to 
				mate with female horses to produce mules; the biological "reciprocal" of a mule, from a stallion and jenny as its parents instead, 
				is called a hinny.</p>
				<p>Asses were first domesticated around 3000 BC, probably in Egypt or Mesopotamia,[6][7] and have spread around the world. They 
				continue to fill important roles in many places today. While domesticated species are increasing in numbers, the African wild ass is 
				an endangered species. As beasts of burden and companions, asses and donkeys have worked together with humans for millennia.</p>
